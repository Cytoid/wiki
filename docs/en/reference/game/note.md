- Simply slide along the line through the small circles.
- You don't need to wait for the scanner, but don't drag too far ahead because you might mess up your rhythm.

- This is a "hybrid" of Click and Drag.
- Its "drag head" has click note's mechanics.
- That means you have to touch when the scanner reaches it, then slide your finger along the line with connecting notes.

- Have your finger on the circle before the scanner has reached it.
- Hold it there until the scanner has gone to the end of the line coming out of the circle.
- You don't need to release it. You also don't need to tap it like the click note, so you can slide onto it like a drag note.

- A variant of the hold note.
- You usually need to hold your finger longer than a page.
- You can see how long you need to hold if you look at the pulsing ring around the circle.
