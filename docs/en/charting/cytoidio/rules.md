## Certain songs are blacklisted from the Cytoid.io database.
- The following list provides a series, game, or artist’s work that you cannot upload to cytoid.io due to copyright or artists’ wishes (remixes are allowed as long as it’s not the original). Songs that originate, feature, or exclusive to the following games or artists cannot be used. Songs that are featured as part of a game collaboration are fine as long as the collaborating game is also not in the following list.
- Any artwork or assets that also originate, feature, or exclusive to the following games or artists also cannot be used.
- This list may be updated in the future.
   1. Companies and Games
      - Rayark Inc. / Cytus, Cytus II, Deemo, Deemo II, VOEZ
      - lowiro / Arcaea
   2. Artists
      - HyuN
   3. Other works
      - Freedom Dive - xi
      - Conflict - siromaru + Cranky
      - PUPA - Morimori Atsushi
## Proper metadata is required.
- Linking to the song source and illustrator source is required. Do not put “Unknown”, “google.com”, etc.
- Do not use “cytoid” or “io” anywhere in the level ID. This is reserved for event and official levels and we will delete any non-approved levels that include these keywords.
- Do not put yourself as the artist or illustrator if you did not make the song/illustration.
- If you, the charter, created your own song/illustration, you are allowed to not include a source for that specific section. Song edits (such as trimming the song down to length) and/or Photoshopped backgrounds do not fall under this category, and must include the source.
- For level ID, follow this format or use a variation of it:
(charter name).(name of song)
- The title of the level should be in its original language or official translation. Use the “title_localized” parameter to put an alternate song title.
- For reasons listed in 1. Certain songs are blacklisted from the Cytoid.io database, we recommend not using difficulty names from existing rhythm games, such as CHAOS, GLITCH, Future, etc.
## Song metadata
- The song source must direct to
   - The video/song where the artist or company uploaded it
   - The artist’s YouTube, SoundCloud, or any other source that the artist uploaded it.
- If unable to find the song on the artist’s, link to the album or single that the song came from. You may use an album details site for this if the original album page is down.
- Using a reuploaded source must always be the last solution.
## Illustration metadata
- The illustration source must direct to
   - The image where the illustrator uploaded it
   - The image where the illustrator permitted it to be used (eg. a promotion image for a game or company).
   - The original illustrator’s Twitter, Tumblr, Pixiv, or any other source that the original creator has uploaded the image. 
- Never use a reuploaded source for this. (source that does not come from the artist or other official or permitted use from the artist. This includes reuploads that credit the artist).
- Respect the illustrator’s rules. If anywhere they explicitly say that their work is not for personal or commercial use, don’t use it. You may ask for permission to use the image from the illustrator, but if you do, we recommend letting a moderator from the Cytoid Discord Server know about this.
   - Use saucenao to find the source of an image if you don’t have it already or are having trouble finding the source.
- If the illustration comes from a game (eg. screenshot of the game or the illustration is a background/wallpaper), we recommend attempting to do a reverse image search with saucenao before using the game’s name as the source.
- If the illustration comes from a video or a screenshot of the video (such as a music video’s title card) and the illustrator officially participated in the making of the video, you can use the link to the video.
## Storyboard metadata
- You may include sources for storyboard assets in the description of the level instead of the illustrator if necessary.
- Storyboard source should be roughly treated the same as illustrator metadata with the following exceptions:
   - Double linking isn’t necessary (eg. sources for assets used doesn’t need to be linked if the illustrator source also contains the assets)
   - If a video is used for the storyboard, unless the video is made by the charter, link to the video used if the illustrator source doesn’t include it.
## Do not plagiarize.
- It is ok to copy patterns into your own chart, but do not take someone else’s charts and upload it as your own, even with your own edits or variations.
- Works (songs, illustrations, or other special cases) that have been plagiarized also fall under this category, even if the charter did not intend to plagiarize.
##  Keep NSFW down to a minimum.
- Things such as sexual content, pornography, and imagery of “private” parts are disallowed, but some content are acceptable to a respectable degree, including nudity or offensive language.
